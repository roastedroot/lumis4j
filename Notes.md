Lumis looks promising
- The first execution is VERY slow, but the subsequent are fast, let's try to use wizer
- Adding more languages cause the build to take forever, also I'm unsure about performance
- Check the Rust API to be exposed, complete it
- make Terminal output/html etc configurable

low priority:
- nice to have: automate Theme enum generation
